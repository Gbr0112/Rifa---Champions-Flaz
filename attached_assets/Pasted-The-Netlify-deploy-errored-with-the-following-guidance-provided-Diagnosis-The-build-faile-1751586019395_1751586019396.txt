The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed with the error message:

```
Could not resolve entry module "client/index.html".
```

This error occurred during the build script execution when running `npm run build`.

**Solution:**
It seems that the build process is unable to locate the entry module `"client/index.html"`. To resolve this issue, ensure that the file `index.html` exists in the correct location within the `client` directory.

Verify that `client/index.html` is correctly placed in the repository and commit it so that it is available during the build process. Double-check the path to ensure it matches the expected location.
