The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
[line 62](#L62): The build failed with a non-zero exit code due to a specific error.
[line 66](#L66): The error "Could not resolve entry module 'client/index.html'" indicates that the entry module specified in the build script is not found.

### Solution
The error "Could not resolve entry module 'client/index.html'" suggests that the entry module specified in the build script is incorrect or missing. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the entry module 'client/index.html' exists in the correct location in your project.
2. Update the configuration in the build script to point to the correct entry module.

If the file `client/index.html` is missing or referenced incorrectly, ensure it exists in your repository. If it does exist, update the build script or configuration to reference the correct path for the entry module.
